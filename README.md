Built a Google Momentum clone in 2 hours solo, seamlessly integrating OpenWeatherMap and Unsplash APIs for dynamic quotes and wallpapers. Leveraging ReactJS, Tailwind CSS, and Axios, I delivered an engaging user experience within a short timeframe, showcasing my efficiency, problem-solving skills, and ability to independently learn new technologies.
